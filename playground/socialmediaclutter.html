            <h3>Executive Summary</h3>

            <p>Digital clutter and digital hoarding have been shown to decrease mental health. However, current research
                focuses on general digital clutter, and solutions exist to fix the issue instead of preventing it. Our
                research focuses on social media and looks at the motivations and circumstances around why people save
                content, and how they interact with it. Digital clutter deeply affects usability and accessibility, and
                as a result, is a necessary topic to explore.</p>

            <p>We recruited eight participants for an observational study through DePaul’s CDM Participant Pool. All
                participants were 18 years or older and willing to screen share their Pinterest, TikTok, or Instagram
                applications. We gave scenario-based tasks to participants to gather two main insights: how digital
                clutter builds up on social media, and how users engage with it.</p>

            <p>We created an affinity diagram and categorized our findings and insights into the following three themes:
            </p>

            <ul style="list-style: decimal;">
                <li>
                    <b>Saving Habits.</b> Users save content to personal folders. This content is also similar to
                    content they have saved in the past. This informs our insight that saving content is a passive
                    process, requiring minimal work from the user.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Content Type.</b> Users save two types of content, promotional (e.g. products, events, and
                    restaurants) and inspirational (e.g. ideas for design, home decor, etc.). From this, we drew the
                    insight that users engage with saved content differently, in terms of frequency and length,
                    depending on the content type. Our recommendation is to introduce a nudge system to motivate users
                    to act upon their promotional saved items.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Organizational Motivation and Retrieval.</b> Users save content to pre-existing folders with the
                    aim of revisiting it in the future. From these findings, our team came up with the insight that
                    users consistently prioritize convenience in their interactions with social media content,
                    regardless of their degree of organization. Adding a suggested or AI-driven organizational system
                    can simplify the process of organizing content, increasing convenience for users. This finding also
                    highlights the relationship between organization and retrieval. Introducing a search feature can
                    improve users’ ability to retrieve saved content.

        <div class="project-detail">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <p>Through advancements in technology, users can create and collect digital content, such as videos or
                files, more efficiently than ever. As a result, the volume of digital content in an individual’s digital
                collection continues to increase and users are now faced with digital clutter. Unlike physical clutter
                that might exist in a few physical spaces, digital clutter spans multiple personal tech devices,
                websites, and even social platforms (Uğur & Caliskan, 2022; Zhao et al., 2013). For example, a user
                might have pictures on their phone and computer, in iCloud and Google drive, and on more than one social
                media platform. Additionally, users are more likely to build up digital clutter than physical. This is
                because digital spaces are more flexible and have less spatial limitations, thanks to technology like
                cloud storage (Sweeten et al., 2018).</p>

            <p>Digital clutter and digital hoarding have been shown to decrease mental health and well-being, so it is
                important to explore how we can mitigate it (Sweeten et al., 2018; Neave et al., 2020). Digital clutter
                is a human-computer interaction issue at its core because it affects usability and deals with the
                cognitive load of using interfaces. Additionally, addressing the reasons for digital clutter can enhance
                accessibility, ensuring organized and clean digital spaces for everyone.</p>

            <p>Our study adds to the current conversation of digital clutter by exploring how it builds up on
                individuals’ social media, as well as users’ potential mitigation strategies. Current research mostly
                focuses on digital clutter as a whole, and does not look at specific digital spaces, like social media.
                We hope to bridge this gap with our research. Additionally, existing products to deal with digital
                clutter, such as Unroll.me for email, focus on responding to digital clutter that has already built up.
                We believe it necessary to take a holistic approach to look at how and why digital clutter accumulates.
                Our study seeks to understand the motivations and circumstances behind saving content on social media.
                Specifically, we observe users’ saving behaviors and how they interact with saved content. Through our
                research, our team hopes to provide potential design implications to mitigate digital clutter on social
                media platforms and improve mental health.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-detail">
            <h3>Methods</h3>
            <p>
                We recruited participants through the CDM Participant Pool, and the basis for recruitment was their
                screen responses. We accepted active social media platform users who were 18 years or older and willing
                to share their mobile screens. Participants were informed that their screens, which displayed either
                TikTok, Pinterest, or Instagram, would be recorded for the observational study. We recruited a total of
                eight participants, six of which shared their Instagram content, one shared Pinterest, and one shared
                TikTok. The studies were conducted remotely and participants were asked to review and sign a consent
                form before the study.
            </p>
            <p>
                The studies began after introducing the project and gaining verbal consent from the subjects. Two
                scenario-based tasks and several follow-up questions were asked. For the first task, we were interested
                in seeing how content clutter might build up. For the second task, we wanted to see how they interacted
                with this saved content. To gather impartial observations, we let participants perform tasks
                uninterrupted and only spoke when necessary. We went back to the study recordings to take notes and
                ensure accurate data was being recorded for the research.
            </p>
            <p>
                The team used open coding to do qualitative analysis. We then consolidated our notes in an affinity
                diagram (see <a href="#AC">Appendix C</a>) on FigJam.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-detail">
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <p>
                We summarized our observation and wrap-up question findings into three categories using an affinity
                diagram (see <a href="#AC">Appendix C</a>):
            </p>

            <ul style="list-style: decimal;">
                <li>
                    Saving habits
                </li>
                <li>
                    Content type and interactions
                </li>
                <li>
                    Motivations for organization
                    <ul style="list-style:lower-alpha;">
                        <li>
                            Why users save content
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How users save content
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>SAVING HABITS.</b></p>

            <p>
                All participants saved content to personal folders. Only one participant additionally saved to a shared
                folder. In both cases, participants noted a social aspect to their saving habits; several participants
                stated they were saving content to share with friends later. We also observed that content was only
                saved to pre-existing boards, instead of creating new ones. Because of this, most of the content saved
                by participants was related to content they had previously saved in some way.
            </p>

            <p><b>CONTENT TYPE.</b></p>

            <p>
                When observing participants revisit previously saved content, we noted two primary categories of
                content: promotional and inspirational. Promotional content included products, events, and restaurants,
                while inspirational content included ideas for design, home decor, etc., or content that the user simply
                enjoyed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Promotional content prompted most interactions. These were also more active in nature, with participants
                clicking on links associated with these posts. Some participants opened external applications to
                continue browsing about the topic. For example, one user found a restaurant they had saved a video
                about, and looked up reviews and directions. As such, these interactions were longer and more engaging
                in nature. Conversely, inspirational content had less frequent, passive, and short interactions.
                Participants typically viewed these posts without further engagement.
            </p>

            <p><b>ORGANIZATIONAL MOTIVATION.</b></p>

            <p><em>Why users save content</em></p>

            <p>
                Participants stated that they saved content that they aimed to revisit, and saving would allow them to
                find it more easily in the future.
            </p>

            <p><em>How users save content</em></p>

            <p>
                Almost all participants noted in the wrap-up that they value organization in their daily lives. However,
                this translated to social media to varying degrees. Every participant had a catch-all folder, which one
                participant likened to a junk drawer. Examples of this for social media include the default “all posts”
                folder on Instagram, the “likes” tab on TikTok, and personally created catch-all folders. Some of these
                participants used more particular content organization as well, and had specific folders for each
                content type. Users who had pre-existing organization systems used their catch-all less frequently.

            <h3>Discussion</h3>

            <p>Our objective for this study was to contribute to existing literature about digital clutter. We explored
                its presence on social media, considered the motivations and behaviors behind it, and examined its
                effects on mental health.</p>

            <p>Based on our findings, our team identified four key insights:</p>

            <ul style="list-style: decimal;">
                <li>Content type affects behavior</li>
                <li>Convenience is a priority</li>
                <li>Users save for retrieval</li>
                <li>Saving content is a passive process</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>CONTENT TYPE AFFECTS BEHAVIOUR.</b></p>

            <p>
                Our participants engaged with saved content differently, in terms of frequency and length, depending on
                if the content was promotional or inspirational. Introducing a technology-based nudge system has the
                potential to motivate users to act upon their saved promotional items, such as by visiting a saved
                restaurant or buying a saved item, helping prevent accumulation of digital clutter.
            </p>

            <p><b>CONVENIENCE IS A PRIORITY.</b></p>

            <p>
                Our participants consistently prioritized convenience in their interactions with content on social
                media, regardless of their degree of organization. Our participants with high-effort organization
                systems, such as distinct categorical folders, achieved long-term convenience by using those systems to
                create organization and easy retrieval. Alternatively, our users with low-effort or no organization
                systems received immediate convenience by saving content without organizing it. Adding a suggested or
                AI-driven organizational system has the potential to simplify the content organization process,
                increasing convenience for users.
            </p>

            <p><b>USERS SAVE FOR RETRIEVAL.</b></p>

            <p>
                Many of our participants verbalized that they save content with the intention of referencing it later.
                From those participants, the ones who incorporated high-effort organizational systems were able to
                easily access their saved content. It is important to highlight this relationship between organization
                and retrieval. The introduction of a search feature has the potential to improve users’ ability to
                retrieve saved content.
            </p>

            <p><b>SAVING CONTENT IS A PASSIVE PROCESS.</b></p>

            <p>
                Our participants spent a brief period of time saving content. As noted in the findings, users saved
                content similar to their previously saved content, and only saved to pre-existing boards. These
                observations informed our insight that saving content is a passive process, requiring minimal effort
                from the user.
            </p>

            <p><b>LIMITATIONS.</b></p>

            <p>
                Although our research offers valuable insights, it is important to address its limitations. In our
                study, users had the option to share from either Instagram, Pinterest, or TikTok. Among our sample size
                of eight participants, six users selected to share from Instagram, while Pinterest and TikTok were
                chosen by one user each. Each of these social media platforms have their own distinctive features in
                regards to users actively browsing, saving, and revisiting content. Given our uneven distribution of
                participants from each social media platform, it is crucial that we recognize that our data is primarily
                influenced by user experiences with Instagram. Because of this, it may not accurately reflect user
                behaviors, attitudes, and experiences across all major social media platforms. Furthermore, we recruited
                through the DePaul CDM participant pool, limiting our demographics in terms of age and education. This
                may not accurately reflect the diverse profiles of many social media users who struggle with digital
                clutter. Therefore, our data and findings may have low external validity, making it less generalizable
                to broader populations.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-detail">
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>
                Moving forward, we plan to conduct a series of interviews aimed at continuing our exploration of digital
                clutter on social media, including the motivations behind it, how it builds up, and its effects on
                mental health. Through these interviews, we hope to discover insights that can inform further design
                solutions. It would also be beneficial to include participants with experiences across a wider range of
                social media platforms.
            </p>
