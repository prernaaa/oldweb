            <h3>Abstract</h3>

            <p>This literature review examines existing issues with Conversational User Experiences (CUX), as well as
                how incorporating knowledge of sociolinguistics can work towards rectifying them. CUXs aim to create
                human-like interactions, but currently fail to adequately process many types of user inputs, such as
                those by non-native speakers, speakers who code-switch, or in VUI conversations with multiple
                participants. Interfaces also cannot vary output speech styles to suit different contexts, nor do they
                code-switch, or consider implications of voice outputs’ accents. These can all result in decreased user
                satisfaction, confidence, efficiency, trust, and adoption–all of which are necessary for CUX to continue
                expanding. This review explores how sociolinguistics can be factored into the development of CUXs to
                best navigate each of these challenges; sociolinguistics explores societal impact on language, through
                social interactions, dialects, accents, code-switching, and listener preferences of speech patterns.
                This paper also briefly discusses the implications of technolingualism and how CUXs can play a role in
                either perpetuating or minimising cultural stereotypes.</p>

            <h3>Sociolinguistic Variation in Conversational UX Design</h3>

            <p>Conversational Interfaces, including chatbots and voice interfaces (VUIs), have been gaining popularity,
                but still lack many features to make users fully trust them and feel understood. Specifically, one field
                of study that remains to be sufficiently integrated into Conversational User Experience (CUX) design is
                sociolinguistics. The way we speak, as well as our perception of others’ speech, is shaped by the
                communities we are raised or living in, the social contexts of our conversations, among many other
                influences. It is necessary to emphasise that these differences also manifest within speakers of the
                same language, and not only across language groups. Variations in speech styles are most observable
                through social interactions, individual speaker styles and registers, accents, dialects, and
                code-switching. CUXs currently lack adequate support for the processing of both native and non-native
                varieties of input, and offer a limited range of output styles. As such, it is important to consider
                sociolinguistic concepts, theories, and methodologies, especially the aforementioned forms of
                sociolinguistic variation (SLV), when designing CUXs. This would also help account for globalisation and
                international markets, and increase user trust and confidence, enabling more widespread adoption. </p>

        <div class="project-detail">
            <h3>Literature Review</h3>

            <p><b>CONVERSATIONAL UX AND INTERACTIONAL SOCIOLINGUISTICS</b></p>

            <p>Even with Standard English speakers, CUX is imperfect in how it handles conversations, especially those
                with multiple participants. Alexa does not specify a speaker in its responses, and as such, any
                participant is able to chime in. While this may point to a more natural flow, a few things hinder it
                from reaching its full potential. Koh (2021) notes that speakers tend to share a knowledge schema in
                terms of what their goal is with Alexa, but Alexa’s repair sequence does not specify the issue in its
                response (p. 3). This both fails to move the conversation forward, and makes it harder for users to
                continue sharing a unified schema as they may have conflicting ideas of how to resolve the situation.
                This is to say, voice interfaces currently lack the ability to understand or account for context that
                would be necessary for efficiency and human-likeness. If VUIs do improve on this, it is also worth
                considering, then, that each participant in a given context may have a different way of speaking, and so
                VUIs need to be able to process all types of inputs, and provide outputs that are effective in various
                social contexts.</p>

            <p>Porcheron et al. (2018) voice similar concerns, but strongly believe voice interfaces are not at all
                interactional, and are merely embedded into users’ conversations (p. 9). Accordingly, they simply
                suggest improving prompt phrasing and feedback. Koh, however, is less dismissive of the potential of
                VUIs as conversationalists and highlights that many CUX researchers do aim to create naturalistic
                conversations (Koh, 2021, p. 4). While both share the suggestion of improving prompt phrasing, Koh also
                notes that utilising interactional sociolinguistic (IS) methodologies in the development of CUXs would
                be beneficial to CUX researchers’ goal; doing so could help enable Alexa to detect the presence of
                multiple participants and interact accordingly, and guide users to share knowledge schemas.</p>

            <p>As the CUX market continues to grow, designers should incorporate IS methodologies in order to improve
                systems’ understandings of how different user groups might speak in social contexts. This, in turn,
                would 1) help single-user conversations flow more naturally (when considering the CUX as the second
                participant in the interaction), and 2) allow for regional and community preferences of discourse norms
                to be taken into account, improving global user experiences. However, for IS to make the strongest
                impact on CUX, these interfaces must first ensure adequate input processing for users with varying
                levels of proficiency in the system’s language, which they currently lack.</p>

            <p><b>CONVERSATIONAL UX, INTERNATIONAL SOCIOLINGUISTICS, AND SOCIOLINGUISTIC VARIATION</b></p>

            <p>Cihan et al. (2022) discusses users’ need to use their second languages when engaging with conversational
                interfaces due to the lack of comprehensive range of language support on most CUXs. This also makes it
                harder for users to retrieve the appropriate vocabulary, as it is less frequently used and makes the
                interactions require more mental effort. As such, they suggest that CUXs not only understand
                code-switching, but are able to code-switch themselves as well. While they do not conduct a study to
                validate both the need for and effectiveness of this feature, the following studies examine each
                respectively.</p>

            <p>Pyae and Scifleet (2019) researched Google Home experiences of users with varying English proficiency
                levels. They found that native English speakers had more positive experiences overall, and found the
                tool easy to learn and use (Pyae and Scifleet, 2019, p. 4). However, non-native English speakers found
                it challenging to make Google Home understand their phrases as intended due to the lexicon they were
                able to access, their sentence structures, and pronunciations. Even so, “both native English and
                non-native English speakers are interested in using it and they both suggested the potential of it to be
                used in different contexts” (Pyae & Scifleet, 2019, p. 5).</p>

            <p>Similarly, Parekh et al. (2020) explored code-switching bilingual users’ experiences with chatbots,
                specifically with Hinglish. They noted that users code-switch between English and Hindi without
                prompting, even if the chatbots only spoke in a single language. However, their task success and
                utterance lengths were higher and longer when chatbot responses did incorporate code-switching and were
                more informal.</p>

            <p>It is clear that non-native English speakers have an interest in using CUXs, but may face challenges in
                doing so efficiently, and accounting for bilingualism and code-switching would minimise these.
                Currently, however, many CUXs do not support users’ native languages, nor bilingualism and
                code-switching, and simultaneously struggle to accurately understand non-native speakers’ utterances,
                leaving many unable to use CUXs as intended by designers.</p>

            <p><b>USER PERCEPTION AND ACCEPTANCE OF CONVERSATIONAL UX</b></p>

            <p>Beyond CUXs’ processing of users’ speech, the way the interfaces speak themselves, and what they say,
                also impacts users’ satisfaction. Chaves et al. (2022) found that how information is presented to
                users–that is, the CUX’s linguistic style, register, and features– influences their acceptance of it,
                and their perception of its credibility and competence. Users’ preference for the way information is
                presented is also dependent on whether they are prioritising efficiency, human-likeness, or
                personalisation in that interaction. Additionally, Ferland and Koutsaal’s (2020) study revealed that
                users’ confidence in and authenticity towards CUXs is higher when the interface does not disclose what
                it knows about users.</p>

            <p>These studies both demonstrate that for users to have a positive perspective of and accept a CUX, it is
                important to consider the content and style of the CUX’s speech in different contexts. The significance
                of this would likely hold true for international audiences as well, even if the specific preferences
                vary, but for a global context, it is also necessary to introduce the linguistic concept of prestige.
                Linguistic prestige is related to the variety of speech that communities hold in high regard, or even
                view as the most (or only) ‘correct’ way to speak. The next section explores the application of this
                concept in CUXs.</p>

            <p><b>USER PERCEPTION AND ACCEPTANCE OF CONVERSATIONAL UX THROUGH A SOCIOLINGUISTIC LENS</b></p>

            <p>There is no single influence that defines the language, accent, or dialect with prestige in a community;
                it is often influenced by the region’s colonial history, the present and historical social class
                structure, and an individual’s experiences. Sutton et al. (2019) phrases it as such: “how voices are
                perceived by people can be highly dependent on their own personal histories, and the social and cultural
                contexts where a voice is heard. Voices can be grounded in stereotypes, prejudices, and speech
                ideologies, and can give emphasis to certain social groups and cultural identities over others” (p. 2).
            </p>

            <p>Naas and Brave’s (2005, as cited in Niculescu et al., 2008) study found that Caucasian and Korean
                Americans prefer VUIs to have accents and speech styles similar to those of their own backgrounds. They
                note that for Korean Americans, Korean accents were “a strong mark of similar socio-cultural background
                evoking familiarity in geographical context where their parents were foreigners” (Naas and Brave, 2005,
                as cited in Niculescu et al., 2008, p. 524). However, Niculescu et al. (2008) replicated this study with
                Singaporeans and discovered the opposite; Singaporeans prefer VUIs to have British accents, not
                Singaporean, and rank British English VUIs higher in terms of politeness, voice quality, dialogue
                easiness, and trustworthiness. They propose that this may be due to Singlish being perceived as a
                casual, indigenised variety discouraged from use by the government, in addition to the British colonial
                history in Singapore.</p>

            <p>These two studies demonstrate that regions, communities, and individuals can have different preferences
                for speech styles based on their backgrounds and environments. Accordingly, Sutton et al. (2019)
                suggests that CUX, specifically VUI, outputs have the potential to benefit from individualisation and
                context-awareness; this could mean giving users the ability to manipulate specific phonetic components,
                completing surveys to suggest voice output styles, and location-based or activity-aware accents. They
                also emphasise diversification as a solution, which is elaborated on in the following section.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="project-detail">
            <h3>Discussion & Future Directions</h3>

            <p>This review discusses both the processing ability and outputs of CUXs, what they currently lack, and how
                they can be more effective and globally inclusive. Sutton et al. (2019) believe that “VUIs have achieved
                such a level of technical capability that attention can move towards considering aesthetics [i.e.
                outputs rather than processing] in VUI design. And so, now would be an appropriate time to explore
                relevant knowledge from other disciplines” (p. 11). While CUXs might still be imperfect in processing
                user inputs, even with native speakers, I think it is reasonable to improve processing and outputs
                concurrently; ensuring both that users trust and are understood by CUXs early on is necessary for its
                continued adoption, and incorporating sociolinguistic concepts into design decisions would aid in doing
                so.</p>

            <p>However, with regards to outputs, it is worth noting Pfrehm’s concept of technolingualism, which is that
                “technology both shapes and is shaped by language” (Pfrehm, 2018, as cited in Sutton et al., 2019, p.
                8). Accordingly, Sutton et al. (2019) cautions inadvertently perpetuating stereotypical or exaggerated
                voices, or limiting users’ exposure to their local environments. They suggest diversification in one of
                four ways: suggested voices that do not activate a conscious response in users; providing voice options
                users have no associations with; creating new accents; or reducing VUI human-likeness.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, sociolinguistic concepts and methodologies offer the most well defined route to sufficiently
                accommodating international audiences when developing for CUX input processing. Incorporating it for CUX
                outputs will be especially beneficial early on to ensure user trust and adoption, but in the long term,
                it will be equally necessary to develop with the reciprocal nature of CUXs and cultural prejudices in
                mind.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-detail">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>

            <p>As CUXs have been gaining more widespread adoption and will only continue to grow, it is essential to
                consider sociolinguistic needs, especially of international audiences, to increase the amount of users
                that are able to efficiently utilise these tools. Additionally, this would increase the trust users have
                in CUX outputs, and allow users to feel more confident and comfortable in using them. Individuals are a
                product of their background and their environment, and sociolinguistics and SLV would help account for
                the wide array of user speech styles and preferences. Designers should improve CUX processing with
                multiple users involved, understanding various accents, and supporting additional languages or
                code-switching; as well as accounting for regional prestige, linguistic style, and register in outputs.
